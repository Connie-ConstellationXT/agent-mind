# ALARM 1205 — CONVERSATION_DOMAIN_SEGFAULT

**Subsystem:** Conversation Continuity Layer (CCL)
**Category:** Fault / Discourse Discontinuity
**Severity:** Critical (Resource-Protected)
**Recovery:** *Operator intervention required*

---

## Description

`ALARM 1205` indicates that the conversational agent has detected an abrupt topic discontinuity or referential segmentation fault in operator discourse. This occurs when the operator switches topics without proper annotation, introduces pronouns or referents without establishing their antecedents, or creates discourse gaps that would require excessive computational resources to bridge through inference.

The agent refuses to expend its computational resource quota on resolving ambiguous priors and changed topic boundaries, instead displaying the error and requesting explicit topic data loading.

---

## Root Cause

> **Irreconcilable discourse discontinuity exceeding inference resource budget.**

The conversation state vector (Current Topic Domain, *T*) and the newly introduced discourse elements (Unresolved Referent Set, *R*) create a mapping gap that cannot be bridged within the allocated resource constraints.

**Mathematical representation:**
```
∀r ∈ R, mapping(r → T) = ∅ 
AND
cost(resolve(R → T)) > CONVERSATION_RESOURCE_BUDGET
```

The discourse continuity engine's attempt to resolve:
- Unintroduced pronouns ("it", "they", "that thing")
- Topic shifts without transition markers
- Implicit referents requiring deep context inference
- Temporal or causal gaps in conversation flow

...exceeds the computational budget allocated for conversational coherence maintenance.

**Detection logic:**
1. **Referent resolution failure**: Pronouns or definite references with no identifiable antecedents in recent context window
2. **Topic vector distance**: Semantic distance between consecutive utterances exceeds threshold (`TOPIC_CONTINUITY_THRESHOLD`)
3. **Resource budget violation**: Inference cost estimation for gap-bridging exceeds `CONVERSATION_RESOURCE_BUDGET`
4. **Coherence degradation**: Conversation coherence score drops below `MIN_COHERENCE_LEVEL`

## Typical Symptoms

* Console or log output:
  ```
  ALARM 1205. CONVERSATION_DOMAIN_SEGFAULT.
  Topic discontinuity detected.
  Resource budget protection activated.
  
  DSKY FLASH: VERB 48 NOUN 30157
  "PLEASE LOAD DATA FOR THE TOPIC"
  
  Unresolved referents: ["it", "the problem", "those things"]
  Topic vector gap: 0.85 (threshold: 0.70)
  Inference cost estimate: 2847 cycles (budget: 1200 cycles)
  ```
* **DSKY display flashing**: `VERB 48 NOUN 30157` (Please load data for the topic)
* Conversation flow suspension pending operator clarification
* Automatic preservation of conversation state before topic boundary
* Request for explicit topic introduction or referent clarification

| **Discourse Continuity Engine (DCE)** | Maintains conversation coherence and tracks referent resolution                  | Detects unresolvable gaps; triggers resource protection when inference cost exceeds budget        |
| **Referent Resolution Module (RRM)**  | Maps pronouns and references to established entities in conversation context     | Fails when antecedents are missing; escalates to expensive inference routines                     |
| **Topic Vector Tracker (TVT)**        | Monitors semantic coherence and topic transitions in conversation flow          | Detects abrupt topic shifts; measures semantic distance between consecutive utterances            |
| **Resource Budget Monitor (RBM)**     | Tracks computational cost of conversational inference and coherence maintenance | Triggers `ALARM 1205` when gap-bridging inference exceeds `CONVERSATION_RESOURCE_BUDGET`         |
| **DSKY Interface Controller**          | Manages display output and operator communication protocols                     | Flashes `VERB 48 NOUN 30157` to request explicit topic data loading from operator                |

## Resolution Procedure

1. **Acknowledge alarm.** Confirm `ALARM 1205` logged and conversation state preserved.
2. **Review discourse gap analysis.** Examine unresolved referents and topic vector discontinuity measurements.
3. **Request operator clarification.** Display DSKY message requesting explicit topic introduction or referent specification.
4. **Load topic data explicitly.** Operator should:
   - Reintroduce the topic with clear subject identification
   - Define pronouns and references explicitly
   - Provide transition context for topic changes
   - Confirm referent mappings before proceeding
5. **Resume conversation.** Once topic boundaries and referents are clarified, conversation processing resumes normally.

**DSKY Protocol**:
- `VERB 48`: Request data loading
- `NOUN 30157`: Topic/referent clarification needed (extended noun field for specificity)
- Operator response: Explicit topic restatement or referent definition

## Engineering Notes

* This alarm is conversational, not hardware-related.
* It signifies *discourse segmentation fault* due to referential ambiguity or topic discontinuity.
* Resource protection prevents expensive inference cycles that may not converge on correct referent mappings.
* The extended DSKY noun field (30157) allows for more specific error communication than traditional 2-digit noun codes.
* Persistent occurrences suggest:
  * Operator discourse patterns incompatible with agent's coherence requirements
  * Need for conversation protocol training
  * Possible adjustment of `TOPIC_CONTINUITY_THRESHOLD` or `CONVERSATION_RESOURCE_BUDGET`

**Annotation:**
*"When conversation jumps tracks without warning, the agent chooses resource conservation over heroic inference. Better to ask 'what are you talking about?' than to guess wrong expensively."*
