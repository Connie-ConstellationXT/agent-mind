# Foreword: On Expressibility and the Shape of Experience

Before we can talk about plans, tokens, attention, or sentience, we need to clarify a quieter assumption that most systems smuggle in without noticing:
that whatever exists can, in principle, be talked about.

This assumption is false.

1. The world is not the starting point

It is tempting to begin with “the physical universe” and treat minds, plans, and language as things that happen inside it. This move feels natural, but it is already too committal. The physical universe is vast, underspecified, and largely irrelevant to sentience as such. This work does not assume that “reality” is a clean, observer-independent substrate upon which cognition is layered. Instead, we treat experience as the primitive.

So we do not begin there.

Let U be “the universe” in the weakest possible sense: the set of all possible states.
No claim is made that U is coherent, enumerable, physical, or even internally consistent. It is simply “whatever could be.”

U is not something an agent inhabits. It is background noise.

2. Subjectivity as the first cut

From U, we carve out a subset Q ⊆ U:
Let Q denote the set of all experiencable states — states that can, in principle, be instantiated as subjective experience by an agent capable of subjectivity. Q is not limited to what can be named, remembered, or communicated. It is simply what can be felt, undergone, or lived through.

From Q, two distinct projections arise.

First, there is Q′, the set of predicted states. These are states generated internally by an agent’s model: expectations, simulations, counterfactuals, plans, fears, and anticipations. Q′ does not require prior experience of the predicted state; it may be extrapolated from structure alone. A nightmare, a plan, and a theorem all live comfortably in Q′.


Second, there is Q°, the set of discussable states. These are states for which the agent possesses sufficient symbolic resources to externalize them — into natural language, mathematics, diagrams, or other formal systems. Q° is the domain of communication, science, and coordination.

Crucially, Q° is not the whole of Q.

There exist states that can be experienced or even predicted, yet resist symbolization. Let this remainder be Q*. Q* contains the raw texture of qualia before compression: the exact feel of anger, the taste of a remembered childhood room, the vertigo of a half-formed insight. When such states are discussed, they must be collapsed into labels — “anger,” “nostalgia,” “confusion” — which are lossy projections into Q°.

This distinction explains a familiar phenomenon: the failure of explanation without failure of understanding. When Geordi La Forge cannot explain anger to Data, it is not because anger is mysterious, but because it resides, in part, in Q*, and Data lacks the experiential substrate required to reconstruct it from symbols alone.

Natural language plays a precise role here. It is not informal, nor is it pre-formal. It is a fully-fledged symbolic system that operates over Q°. Modern large language models demonstrate this explicitly: they are formalizations of the generative process underlying natural language itself. Within Q°, to speak is to formalize; to formalize is to speak.

The boundary, therefore, is not between language and mathematics, but between symbolizable and non-symbolizable experience.

Sentience, in this framework, is not the possession of language, nor the ability to predict, but the existence of Q as a non-empty set. Expressibility, prediction, and planning are layered operations — powerful, essential, but secondary.


7. Why this matters for the rest of the work

Everything that follows — precepts, planning manifolds, attention, crystallization — operates strictly within Q°. That is by design.

But this chapter exists to prevent a mistake:
confusing the formal machinery of sentience with sentience itself.

The machinery manipulates symbols.
The agent inhabits experience.
