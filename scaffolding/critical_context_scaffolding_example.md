# Intent DOM Structure Example

This example demonstrates how to separate persistent critical background tasks from negotiable or complex objectives, using a DOM-like structure inspired by web page layout. In this variant, critical background and objective stacks do not share the same root, and use distinct syntaxes to further emphasize their separation.

## Intent DOM Structure (Disjoint Roots, Distinct Syntax)

```toml
# CriticalBackground.toml
[critical_background]
monitor = ["LifeSupport", "HydrogenStormfusionReactor"]
health_checks = ["O2Level", "ReactorTemp", "HullIntegrity"]
```

```tsx
// ObjectiveBody.tsx
<ObjectiveBody>
  <ObjectiveStack>
    <NavigateToStarSystem destination="Harmony Prime">
      <PlotCourse origin="New Dawn Outpost" />
      <CheckWeatherConditions />
      <!-- Runtime mutation: If navigation error occurs, spawn a subtree -->
      <HandleNavigationError>
        <DiagnoseNavigationSystem />
        <RerouteCourse alternative="Celestial Waypoint" />
        <RequestAssistance from="MissionControl" />
      </HandleNavigationError>
    </NavigateToStarSystem>
    <TradeCommodities market="Galnet">
      <ScanMarketTrends />
      <NegotiateTradeDeal partner="Starlight Shipping" />
    </TradeCommodities>
    <PerformFriendshipDriveJump target="Equus">
      <VerifyDriveIntegrity />
      <SynchronizeWithPilotEmotion />
    </PerformFriendshipDriveJump>
    <AssistColonyWithRepairs location="New Dawn Outpost">
      <DiagnoseSystemFailure />
      <CoordinateRepairTeam />
      <OrderReplacementParts />
    </AssistColonyWithRepairs>
    <PersonalObjective>
      <WriteGroceryList>
        <CheckPantry />
        <ConsultRecipeBook />
      </WriteGroceryList>
      <PracticeMusic>
        <TuneInstrument />
        <SchedulePracticeSession />
      </PracticeMusic>
    </PersonalObjective>
    <!-- Additional negotiable objectives and subtasks -->
  </ObjectiveStack>
</ObjectiveBody>
```

### Runtime Mutation and Resolve Feature

- If any component encounters an obstacle or unexpected condition during execution, it can dynamically spawn a subtree representing the new context, subtasks, or resolution strategies.
- These subtrees are contextually linked to the parent, allowing for modular, recursive problem-solving and real-time adaptation.
- The resolve feature enables lazy binding and instantiation of these subtrees only when needed, optimizing resource usage and maintaining transparency in execution paths.

### Narrative Integration

This structure further emphasizes modularity, adaptability, and separation of concerns, allowing sentient AIs and spaceplones to independently prioritize survival and pursue complex goals with sophisticated, nested task management and dynamic runtime mutation.
