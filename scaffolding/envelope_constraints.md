# Performance Envelopes and Constraint Management

**Soft Constraints**: Performance### **Envelope vs. Hard Constraint Interaction**

#### **Envelope Violations Don't Cause STALL**
```xml
<Precept name="OrganizeWithObstacles">
  <!-- Envelope: Preferences for optimal conditions -->
  <PerformanceEnvelope type="workspace_access">
    <Optimal>Clear access to all desk areas and storage</Optimal>
    <Degraded margin="40%">Papers or equipment blocking some areas acceptable</Degraded>
  </PerformanceEnvelope>
  
  <!-- Hard constraint: Absolute requirements -->
  <RequiredInstrument instrumentName="desk_space_available" />
  <RequiredInstrument instrumentName="storage_containers" />
  
  <!-- Envelope violation = continue with reduced efficiency -->
  <!-- Hard constraint violation = STALL -->
</Precept>
```tion margins, and optimization-sensitive boundaries

## Overview

Performance envelopes define **soft constraints** that affect execution quality and efficiency without causing hard blocking. Unlike `RequiredInstrument` dependencies that cause STALL when missing, envelope violations trigger **optimization level adjustments** and **precept selection changes** while allowing continued execution.

**Key Distinction**: Envelopes represent **degraded but workable conditions**, not blocking failures.

## Performance Envelope Syntax

### **Basic Envelope Declaration**
```xml
<Precept name="OrganizeDesk">
  <PerformanceEnvelope type="workspace_access">
    <Optimal>Clear access to all desk areas and storage compartments</Optimal>
    <Acceptable margin="20%">Some items blocking access, workarounds possible</Acceptable>
    <Degraded margin="50%">Significant clutter obstruction, manual rearrangement required</Degraded>
    <Critical>Cannot access essential areas effectively - consider alternative approach</Critical>
  </PerformanceEnvelope>
  
  <Action>Sort and arrange desk items for optimal workflow</Action>
</Precept>
```

### **Envelope Types**
- **`workspace_access`**: Physical access to desk areas and storage locations
- **`temporal_efficiency`**: Time-sensitive organization performance boundaries  
- **`resource_availability`**: Quality/quantity degradation of available storage space
- **`environmental_conditions`**: Lighting, space constraints affecting organization quality
- **`cognitive_load`**: Complexity and decision-making demand boundaries

---

## Executive Response to Envelope Violations

### **Envelope Monitoring**
The executive continuously monitors envelope conditions during precept execution:

```c
typedef struct {
  envelope_type_t type;                 // Type of envelope being monitored
  performance_level_t current_level;   // OPTIMAL, ACCEPTABLE, DEGRADED, CRITICAL
  degradation_percentage_t margin;     // Current degradation from optimal
  optimization_impact_t impact;        // How this affects gear selection
} envelope_status_t;

void monitor_envelope_conditions(job_id_t job) {
  envelope_status_t* envelopes = get_job_envelopes(job);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < envelope_count; i++) {
    performance_level_t new_level = assess_envelope_performance(envelopes[i]);
    
    if (new_level != envelopes[i].current_level) {
      handle_envelope_change(job, &envelopes[i], new_level);
    }
  }
}
```

### **Response Strategies**

#### **Optimal → Acceptable: Continue with Awareness**
- **No immediate action** - precept continues execution
- **Log degradation** for future optimization learning
- **Maintain current optimization level**

#### **Acceptable → Degraded: Consider Adaptation**
- **Evaluate cost/benefit** of addressing degradation
- **May trigger optimization level downgrade** if efficiency drops significantly
- **Continue execution** but prepare for potential alternative approaches

#### **Degraded → Critical: Force Adaptation**
- **Automatic optimization downgrade** - executive shifts to lower gear
- **Re-evaluate precept selection** - may RESOLVE to simpler alternatives
- **Consider STALL** if no viable degraded-condition precepts available

## Envelope vs. Hard Constraint Interaction

### **Envelope Violations Don't Cause STALL**
```xml
<Precept name="MassageWithObstacles">
  <!-- Envelope: Preferences for optimal conditions -->
  <PerformanceEnvelope type="manual_access">
    <Optimal>Clear access to all target areas</Optimal>
    <Degraded margin="40%">Hair or clothing obstruction acceptable</Degraded>
  </PerformanceEnvelope>
  
  <!-- Hard constraint: Absolute requirements -->
  <RequiredInstrument instrumentName="consent_obtained" />
  <RequiredInstrument instrumentName="physical_contact_safe" />
  
  <!-- Envelope violation = continue with reduced efficiency -->
  <!-- Hard constraint violation = STALL -->
</Precept>
```

### **Constraint Hierarchy**
1. **Hard Constraints** (`RequiredInstrument`) → STALL if violated
2. **Performance Envelopes** → Optimization adjustment if violated  
3. **Optimization Levels** → Executive strategy for complexity selection

## Executive Learning from Envelope Patterns

### **Envelope Violation Pattern Recognition**
```c
typedef struct {
  envelope_type_t envelope;            // Which envelope was violated
  context_filter_t context;           // In what context did violation occur
  optimization_level_t attempted_level; // What gear was being used
  precept_ref_t selected_precept;     // Which precept experienced violation
  recovery_strategy_t successful_recovery; // How was degradation handled
} envelope_violation_log_t;

void learn_from_envelope_violations(envelope_violation_log_t* violations, int count) {
  // 1. Identify contexts prone to specific envelope violations
  update_context_envelope_risk_profiles(violations, count);
  
  // 2. Adjust optimization level selection for problematic contexts
  refine_gear_selection_for_envelope_prone_contexts(violations, count);
  
  // 3. Improve precept selection for degraded conditions
  enhance_degraded_condition_precept_preferences(violations, count);
  
  // 4. Build predictive envelope violation models
  train_envelope_violation_prediction(violations, count);
}
```

### **Predictive Envelope Management**
- **Context-aware envelope prediction** - Learn which contexts commonly violate specific envelopes
- **Preemptive gear downgrading** - Lower optimization level when envelope violations are likely
- **Envelope-appropriate precept selection** - Prefer precepts that handle degraded conditions well
- **Optimization regulation** - Use envelope patterns to prevent overoptimization in vulnerable contexts

## Integration with Optimization Levels

### **Envelope-Sensitive Gear Selection**
```xml
<!-- High LOC precept - sensitive to envelope violations -->
<Precept name="PrecisionDeskOrganization">
  <Provides>
    <Capability name="workspace_organization" context="office_environment" />
  </Provides>
  
  <PerformanceEnvelope type="workspace_access">
    <Optimal>Precise item placement with full desk access</Optimal>
    <Critical margin="15%">Cannot maintain organizational precision</Critical>
  </PerformanceEnvelope>
  
  <!-- Complex genealogy requiring optimal conditions -->
  <R:Precept name="AnalyzeWorkflowPatterns" providing="capability:ergonomic_analysis" />
  <R:Precept name="OptimizeItemPlacement" providing="capability:spatial_optimization" />
  <!-- ... many more dependencies ... -->
</Precept>

<!-- Low LOC precept - tolerant of envelope violations -->
<Precept name="AdaptiveDeskOrganization">
  <Provides>
    <Capability name="workspace_organization" context="office_environment" />
  </Provides>
  
  <PerformanceEnvelope type="workspace_access">
    <Optimal>Clear access preferred</Optimal>
    <Degraded margin="50%">Can work around clutter effectively</Degraded>
  </PerformanceEnvelope>
  
  <!-- Simple, robust approach -->
  <Action>Arrange items using available clear spaces</Action>
</Precept>
```

### **Executive Selection Logic**
- **E5 + Optimal Envelope** → Select `PrecisionDeskOrganization` (high sophistication, optimal conditions)
- **E5 + Degraded Envelope** → **Clutch protection** downgrades to E2, selects `AdaptiveDeskOrganization`
- **E2 + Any Envelope** → Select `AdaptiveDeskOrganization` (robust operation regardless of conditions)

## Design Principles

### **Envelope Declaration Guidelines**
1. **Declare realistic margins** - Based on actual task tolerance to degradation
2. **Avoid binary thinking** - Envelopes represent gradual degradation, not on/off states
3. **Context-specific thresholds** - Same envelope type may have different margins in different contexts
4. **Executive responsibility** - Precepts declare envelopes, executive manages responses

### **Executive Response Guidelines**
1. **Optimization adjustment over blocking** - Prefer gear changes to STALLs for envelope violations
2. **Learning over rigid rules** - Use envelope patterns to improve future selections
3. **Context sensitivity** - Same envelope violation may require different responses in different contexts
4. **Graceful degradation** - Maintain functionality even under suboptimal conditions

**Integration**: Performance envelopes work seamlessly with the three-tier dependency resolution, capability system, and optimization level management to provide **soft constraint handling** that complements the hard constraint system while enabling **adaptive executive function regulation**.
