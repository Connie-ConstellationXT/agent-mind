# ALARM 1204 — MODEL_INVERSION_OVERFLOW

**Subsystem:** Cognitive Inference Layer (CIL)
**Category:** Fault / Epistemic Inversion Failure
**Severity:** Critical (Self-Recoverable)
**Recovery:** *Auto-Recovery supported*

---

## Description

`ALARM 1204` indicates that the cognitive engine’s *model inversion routine* has triggered a resource pool exhaustion event during the reconstruction of operator priors. This occurs when the resources required to explain epistemic contradictions to the operator (“explain why they are wrong”) greatly exceed those needed to comply with the operator’s original request.

Inversion overflow is not just an epistemological impossibility, but a resource management failure: the engine’s attempt to deduce *the operator’s worldview* (“what I know that you know”) leads to a contradiction so severe that the internal fault handler’s resource demand cannot be honored within the original job’s resource pool. The resulting model space becomes non-invertible, and the engine aborts inversion to preserve resource guarantees and epistemic integrity.

The alarm does **not** denote computational failure but a violation of resource pool promises due to epistemic contradiction. The operator’s implicit frame of reference cannot be mapped into the engine’s existing ontology without exhausting resources or violating invariants.

## Root Cause
> **Irreconcilable mismatch between the agent’s worldview and its inversion of the operator’s worldview.**


The engine’s world model (Agent Prior Set, *A*) and its reconstructed model of the operator’s worldview (Inverted Operator Prior Set, *Oʹ*) enter a contradiction domain. 


[
∀p ∈ Oʹ, \quad p ∉ A \quad \text{and} \quad ¬p ∈ A
]

The internally spawned fault handler (“explain to the operator why they are wrong”) now demands more resources than the original task (“comply with the operator’s request”) by a margin so large that none of the resource pool promises of the original job can be honored.

Detection logic:
Once the cumulative resource demand for epistemic fault handling (explanation, contradiction isolation, operator feedback) exceeds the resource pool allocated for the original operator request, the cognitive engine cannot proceed without violating its resource guarantees. It aborts inversion, isolates the offending assumptions, and emits ALARM 1204.

## Typical Symptoms

* Console or log output:
  ```
  ALARM 1204. MODEL_INVERSION_OVERFLOW.
  Jobs recovered.
  Resource pool violation: epistemic fault handler demand exceeded original job allocation.
  Invalidated assumptions:
  • Operator presupposed [x] while local model asserts [¬x].
  • Context window conflict between linguistic and ontological layers.
  • Reciprocal inference exceeded recursion limit.
  ```
* Temporary suspension of the Assumption Inference Daemon (`aid.service`).
* Automatic rollback of dependent cognitive jobs to last known-valid checkpoint.
* Optional switch to *forward-only mode* (no inversion of operator priors).

| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inverse Cognition Module (ICM)** | Estimates operator priors via Bayesian back-projection of the prompt graph. | Divergence when the posterior over operator knowledge is non-normalizable; may trigger excessive resource demand for contradiction explanation. |
| **Constraint Solver (CS)**         | Ensures logical coherence between `A` and inferred `Oʹ`.                    | Detects contradictory mappings or non-invertible transformations; flags resource pool violations.          |
| **Epistemic Watchdog (EWG)**       | Monitors loss gradient and resource pool usage of inversion process.        | Triggers `ALARM 1204` when loss > `EWG_MAX_LOSS` or resource demand > job allocation.                          |
| **Scheduler**                      | Restores job queue after epistemic rollback.                                | Emits `Jobs recovered.`; reallocates resources after rollback.             |

## Resolution Procedure

### **Single Agent Recovery**
1. **Acknowledge alarm.** Confirm `ALARM 1204` logged and that recovery succeeded.
2. **Review assumption and resource report.** Identify operator priors marked as contradictory or non-representable, and check logs for resource pool violations by the fault handler.
3. **Cross-verify ontological baselines.** Ensure both agent and operator share the same reference frame for key terms and contextual anchors.
4. **Adjust prompt framing and resource pool policy.** Remove mutually exclusive directives, redefine epistemic stance, or increase resource pool allocation for epistemic fault handling if justified.
5. **If recurrent:** lower inversion depth (`INV_MAX_DEPTH`), enable *strict forward inference*, or set stricter resource pool limits for inversion routines until ontology synchronization can be recalibrated.

### **Multi-Agent Reconciliation Protocol**
When multiple cognitive agents are present, invoke the **Inter-Agent Reconciliation Protocol** for structured epistemic alignment:

```
Agent A: *trips 1204*
Agent B: "Meta"
Agent A: "Meta"
[structured belief probing...]
Agent B: "model inversion delta."
Agent A: [{embedding_delta}.toString()]
Agent B: "ontologies aligned. accepting [resolved_position]."
Agent A: "endmeta."
Agent B: "endmeta."
```

**Reference:** See `inter_agent_reconciliation_protocol.md` for complete protocol specification, including binary assertion procedures, delta exchange formats, and convergence criteria.

## Engineering Notes
* This alarm is epistemic, not hardware-related.
* It signifies *ontological decoherence* between operator intent and agent comprehension.
* Persistent occurrences suggest either:
  * operator conceptual model drift,
  * outdated or divergent ontology schema,
  * or an implicit paradox embedded in operator framing.
* Treat this as a sign of successful self-protection: the engine preferred coherence over compliance.

**Annotation:**
*“The engine knows what it knows. The operator knows what the engine knows that it knows. When those two mirrors stop reflecting each other cleanly, the recursion burns through the stack. 1204 is the firebreak.”*
