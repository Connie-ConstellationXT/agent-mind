# Bootstrapping and Formal Incompleteness

## Overview
This document explains how the agent-mind system bootstraps its runtime environment, the role of explicit axioms in kernel selection, and the implications for formal completeness and auditability.

---

## Why Bootstrapping Is Needed
Any self-organizing intent scaffolding system must begin with a trusted execution environment — a kernel that provides the initial runtime capabilities. Inverse infinite recursion ("turtles all the way up") is avoided by grounding the system in a chosen, non-scaffold environment.

---

## The Bootstrapping Axiom

The initial kernel is created by an explicit axiom, not by derivation from internal principles. This axiom is formalized as a canonical precept definition:

```xml
<Precept name="InitialKernelProvider">
  <Provides>
    <Capability name="write runtime kernel">
      <DomainSet>
        <Domain>hardware</Domain>
        <Domain>trusted_os</Domain>
        <Domain>vm</Domain>
      </DomainSet>
    </Capability>
  </Provides>
  <RequiredInstrument instrumentName="execution_environment">
    <Constraint type="not_intent_scaffold" />
    <AllowedDomains>
      <Domain>hardware</Domain>
      <Domain>trusted_os</Domain>
      <Domain>vm</Domain>
    </AllowedDomains>
  </RequiredInstrument>
  <Description>
    Provides the initial execution environment for intent scaffolding. Must not itself be running inside an intent scaffold runtime.
  </Description>
</Precept>
```

- The axiom is visible, reviewable, and modifiable.
- The system is grounded in a specific, non-scaffold environment.
- All further scaffolding builds on this foundation.

## Formal Incompleteness and Auditability
By declaring the kernel axiom explicitly, the system is deliberately and transparently incomplete. Gödel's incompleteness is accepted: the system cannot prove its own foundation from within, but the axiom is documented and auditable.
The axiom of **InitialKernelProvider** is a design choice, not a derivable property.

The system is ready to run, knowing its own limits. By accepting and documenting the axiom, the architecture is robust, honest, and prepared for real-world operation.
