# Cache Tiering and Dynamic Precept Instantiation: Spiciness Override Use Case

This document explains an emergent behavior in intent scaffolding where runtime cache tiers and resolution mechanisms adapt to dynamic requirements. The example demonstrates how an unexpected internal signal, such as a desire for spicier sauce, leads to pruning, dynamic precept instantiation, and intent tree restoration.

---

## What Happened?

### Unexpected Signal for Spiciness
- The signal to desire more spiciness arose from internal environmental factors, such as a situational need (e.g., clearing nasal congestion).
- This preference was not explicitly encoded in the original intent tree but emerged dynamically during execution.
- An MLP output neuron recognized the situation as similar to past scenarios where spicier food was preferred, triggering the runtime to consider spiciness as a relevant factor.
- INFER simulations may have further predicted that the current sauce preparation would not meet the user’s implicit preference for spiciness, contributing to the decision to override the canonical sauce preparation precept.
- Even if INFER did not explicitly simulate spiciness, the fact that the canonical precept lacked a `spiciness_control` performance envelope caused the intent to no longer compile successfully and could cause pruning of the nested sauce preparation precept.

### Canonical Precept Pruned
- The original sauce preparation precept (from the spaghetti kit) lacked a `spiciness_control` performance envelope.
- When the runtime override introduced a spiciness requirement, the canonical precept could no longer fulfill the updated constraints and was pruned.

### New Precept Spawned
- The runtime override dynamically instantiated a new sauce preparation precept with the required `spiciness_control` envelope.
- This new precept:
  - Provided the same capability (`sauce preparation`).
  - Produced the same artifact (`sauce ready`).
  - Included the necessary performance envelope to meet the spiciness requirement.

### Cache Tier Preference
- The newly spawned precept was placed in the **working set (hot cache)**, making it immediately available for resolution.
- During intent tree restoration, the runtime preferred the cached precept over the original intent DOM-defined precept because:
  - It resided in the hot cache. The hot cache (Tier 1) is prioritized over warm cache (Tier 2).
  - It satisfied the updated constraints, restoring the intent tree to a solvable state.

### Emergent Capability
- This behavior was not explicitly designed but emerged from the elegant interaction of:
  - Runtime pruning of unsolvable precepts.
  - Dynamic spawning of precepts to meet updated constraints.
  - Cache tiering and resolution mechanisms favoring the working set.

## Key Mechanisms at Play

### Performance Envelope Mutation
- The spiciness override introduced a new constraint (`spiciness_control`) that the canonical precept could not satisfy because it lacked the necessary performance envelope in its definition.
- Therefore, the canonical precept was pruned from the working set.

### Dynamic Precept Instantiation
- The runtime dynamically instantiated a new precept with the required envelope, ensuring that the workflow could continue.

### Cache Tiering
- The working set (hot cache) naturally prioritized the newly spawned precept during resolution, as it was the most relevant and solvable option.

### Intent Tree Restoration
- After pruning the canonical precept, the runtime resolved the new precept from the cache to restore the intent tree to a solvable state.

---

## Why This is Elegant

### Adaptive Resolution
- The runtime seamlessly adapted to a new requirement (spiciness) without requiring explicit modifications to the intent DOM.

### Cache-Driven Optimization
- The cache tiers ensured that the most relevant precept (the dynamically spawned one) was preferred during resolution.

### Emergent Behavior
- The system's design naturally supported this edge case, demonstrating the robustness and flexibility of the architecture.

### Preservation of Downstream Workflow
- The new precept produced the same artifact (`sauce ready`), ensuring that downstream precepts in the spaghetti dish preparation intent could continue without disruption.

## Example Representation

### Original Sauce Preparation Precept (Pruned)
```xml
<Precept name="PrepareSauce">
  <Description>Prepare sauce using prepackaged ingredients.</Description>
  <Action>Combine prepackaged sauce ingredients in saucepan.</Action>
</Precept>
```

### Dynamically Spawned Precept
```xml
<Precept name="PrepareSpicySauce">
  <Description>Prepare sauce with additional spiciness to meet updated constraints.</Description>

  <PerformanceEnvelope id="spiciness_control">
    <Constraint name="spiciness_level" type="soft" min="5" />
  </PerformanceEnvelope>

  <Action>Locate spice rack.</Action>
  <Action>Grind chili flakes.</Action>
  <Action>Add chili flakes to sauce.</Action>
  <Action>Combine with prepackaged sauce ingredients in saucepan.</Action>

  <Output>
    <Artifact name="sauce_ready">
      <Type>prepared_sauce</Type>
      <Description>Spicy sauce ready for use in spaghetti dish.</Description>
    </Artifact>
  </Output>
</Precept>
```

## Runtime Behavior

### Pruning
- The canonical `PrepareSauce` precept is pruned because it cannot satisfy the `spiciness_control` constraint.

### Dynamic Instantiation
- The runtime spawns the `PrepareSpicySauce` precept to meet the updated constraints.

### Cache Tiering
- The new precept is placed in the working set (hot cache), making it the preferred option during resolution.

### Tree Restoration
- The runtime resolves the new precept from the cache, restoring the intent tree to a solvable state.

---

## Implications

### Robustness
- The system can handle unexpected requirements dynamically, ensuring that workflows remain solvable.

### Scalability
- This behavior scales naturally to other edge cases, as the cache tiering and resolution mechanisms are general-purpose.

### User-Centric Adaptation
- The system adapts to user preferences (e.g., spiciness) without requiring manual intervention or reconfiguration.

## Motivation: Where Did the Spiciness Signal Come From?

The signal to desire more spiciness in this scenario is unexpected and arises from internal environmental factors. While the runtime is designed to handle predictable workflows, this case demonstrates how emergent behavior can adapt to unforeseen preferences. Here’s how the signal originated:

1. **Internal Environmental Factors**:
   - The user’s desire for spicier sauce was driven by a personal, situational need (e.g., clearing nasal congestion).
   - This preference was not explicitly encoded in the original intent tree but emerged dynamically during execution.

2. **MLP Recognition**:
   - An MLP output neuron recognized the situation as similar to past scenarios where spicier food was preferred.
   - This recognition triggered the runtime to consider spiciness as a relevant factor for the current workflow.

3. **INFER Simulation**:
   - INFER simulations may have predicted that the current sauce preparation would not meet the user’s implicit preference for spiciness.
   - This prediction contributed to the decision to override the canonical sauce preparation precept.

4. **Dynamic Adaptation**:
   - The runtime adapted to this unexpected signal by dynamically instantiating a new precept with the required spiciness envelope.
   - This ensured that the workflow could continue while satisfying the user’s situational preference.

This motivation highlights the flexibility of the system to respond to internal environmental signals, even when they are not explicitly defined in the original intent tree.
