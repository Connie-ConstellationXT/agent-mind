# Integration Status — Clean Architecture

The `scaffolding/integration/` folder has been cleaned and now contains only canonical documentation.

## Current Files

- `executive_runtime_architecture.md` — **THE** canonical executive runtime documentation. Single source of truth for job management, dependency resolution, cooperative multitasking, and alarm handling.

- `intent_to_hardware_compilation.md` — **THE** canonical compilation guide. Shows how intent scaffolding precepts compile to RALN hardware networks through the executive runtime.

- `README.md` — This status file.

## What Was Removed

- `modern_raln_integration.md` — Deleted (redundant entropy)
- `legacy/RALN_Scaffolding_Integration.md` — Deleted (confusing duplicate)  
- `merge_report.md` — Deleted (no longer needed)
- `merge_review_list.md` — Deleted (no longer needed)

## Architecture Clarity

The architecture is now clean and unambiguous:

1. **Intent Scaffolding** (`/scaffolding/*.md`) — Declarative cognitive specifications
2. **Executive Runtime** (`executive_runtime_architecture.md`) — Job management and cooperative multitasking 
3. **RALN Hardware** (`/scaffolding/Hardware/RALN.md`) — Universal cognitive primitives
4. **Compilation** (`intent_to_hardware_compilation.md`) — How (1) compiles through (2) to (3)

No duplicates, no entropy, no confusion. Each document has a single, clear responsibility.

## Cross-References

- Executive runtime doc points to compilation guide for hardware details
- Compilation guide references executive runtime as the authoritative job management system
- Both reference the canonical RALN hardware specification in `/scaffolding/Hardware/`

**Status**: Architecture clean, canonical, and ready for implementation.
