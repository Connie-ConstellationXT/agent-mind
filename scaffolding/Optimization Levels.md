# Optimization Levels in Intent Scaffolding

Optimization levels in intent scaffolding represent the system's degree of optimization aggressiveness—how hard the agent tries to achieve rapid, elegant, or value-dense solutions. The model is inspired by a gearbox: each level (1 through 5, plus GE) is a "gear" that trades off time-to-completion and implementation elegance for increased compute demands, less internal stability, and higher risk of stalling. Higher gears (levels) push for faster, more elegant results, but can cause the agent to stall or behave unpredictably if used prematurely or inappropriately—especially when starting a new or poorly understood task. Lower gears provide stability and reliability, making them suitable for initiating tasks or handling complex, uncertain situations. As the agent gains momentum or confidence, it can shift up to higher optimization levels to seek greater efficiency and elegance. The GE (Gamma Entrainment) mode is a special gear for creative leaps and breakthroughs. The A/B mode is for running tasks with minimal observation in background.

## Levels
- **Level 1:** Minimum optimization aggressiveness. The agent prioritizes stability, predictability, and safe progress. Suitable for starting new tasks, handling uncertainty, or when reliability is paramount. Low risk of stall.
- **Level 2:** Slightly increased optimization. The agent begins to seek more efficient or elegant solutions, but still maintains a strong bias toward stability. Moderate risk of stall.
- **Level 3:** Balanced optimization. The agent actively pursues faster or more elegant solutions, using more aggressive strategies and heuristics. Stall risk increases, but so does potential value per effort.
- **Level 4:** High optimization aggressiveness. The agent pushes for rapid, elegant, or highly efficient solutions, accepting significant risk of stall or instability. Suitable for well-understood or already-in-motion tasks.
- **Level 5:** Maximum optimization aggressiveness. The agent uses all available shortcuts, abstractions, and speculative strategies to achieve the fastest or most elegant result possible. Very high risk of stall or unpredictable behavior if used inappropriately.
- **GE (Gamma Entrainment):** Special mode for creative leaps, restructuring, or insight-driven optimization. The agent attempts to provoke a semantic scaffold collapse or eureka moment to achieve a breakthrough in efficiency or understanding. GE is not a "higher gear" but a fundamentally different mode for creative problem-solving.



## A/B Level
- **A/B:** A distinct optimization level where the system runs in autonomous background mode. Tasks at this level are managed with minimal active attention, using spare resources and deferring to higher-priority processes.

Optimization levels allow the system to dynamically adjust its optimization aggressiveness based on context, task state, and risk—much like shifting gears in a vehicle. Starting in a high gear can cause a stall; shifting up as momentum builds enables greater efficiency and elegance. The GE mode provides a pathway for creative or non-linear optimization beyond standard levels.
