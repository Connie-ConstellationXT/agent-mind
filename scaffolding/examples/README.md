# Agent Mind Examples

This folder contains implementation examples and intent scaffold drafts that illustrate how to use the canonical scaffolding docs.

## Current Examples

### `omelette_refactored.xml`
Comprehensive demonstration of enhanced intent scaffolding patterns including:
- Type-safe precept declarations with capability providing/querying
- Staging phases with preflight validation and execution boundaries
- Capability-based instrument resolution using `<Provides>` and `providing="..."`
- Context switch protocols using staging boundaries
- Artifact pipelining between precepts
- Hardware-compatible RALN compilation targets

### `omelette.xml`
Original/legacy example for comparison - shows older patterns before the enhanced type-safe refactoring.

## Usage

Reference these examples from documentation rather than duplicating XML content in `.md` files to reduce maintenance overhead and ensure consistency.
